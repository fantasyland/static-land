# Static Land Specification

This is a specification for common algebraic types in JavaScript based on
[Fantasy Land Specification](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land).


## Type

A type in Static Land is a dictionary (JavaScript object) with static functions as values.
'Static' means that functions don't use `this`, they can be detached from the type object.
The type object is just a container for functions.

```js
const {of, map} = MyType

// This should work
map(x => x + 1, of(41)) // MyType(42)
```

Functions from type object are often called "methods" of the type.
But keep in mind that they are not "methods" in JS sense (they don't use `this`).

## Type signatures

Each method in this spec comes with a type signature, that looks like the following.

```
map :: Functor f => (a → b, f a) → f b
```

We use syntax similar to Haskell's. You can learn about it from
[Ramda's wiki](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/Type-Signatures) or from book
["Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming"](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/ch7.html)

This spec uses the following extensions to the type signature syntax:

  1. `(a, b) → c` denotes a binary function which is not curried. Same for more arguments.
  1. An upper-case letter denotes the [type object](#type) of the type denoted by the same
     letter in lower case. For instance a function with type `(F, f) → a`
     can be called as `fn(F, F.of(1))`.

If a method called with incorrect types the behaviour is unspecified.
Also if a method accepts a function it must only apply the function in accordance with
the type signature (i.e. provide the correct number of arguments of the correct types).

## Equivalence

An appropriate definition of equivalence for the given value should ensure
that the two values can be safely swapped out in a program that respects abstractions.

For example:

 - Two lists are equivalent if they are equivalent at all indices.
 - Two plain old JavaScript objects, interpreted as dictionaries,
   are equivalent when they are equivalent for all keys.
 - Two promises are equivalent when they yield equivalent values.
 - Two functions are equivalent if they yield equivalent outputs for equivalent inputs.

We use `≡` symbol in laws to denote equivalence.


## Algebras

An algebra is a set of values (type instances, and other values), a set of operators
(type methods) that it is closed under and some laws it must obey.

Each algebra is a separate specification.
An algebra may have dependencies on other algebras which must be implemented.

An algebra may also state other algebra methods which can be derived from new methods.
If a type provides a method which could be derived, its behaviour must be equivalent
to that of the derivation (or derivations).
